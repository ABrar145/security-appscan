## Performance of CodeSweep
AppScan CodeSweep was faster and easier to use directly in VS Code compared to CodeQL and 
Bandit. It gave instant feedback when saving files, which was convenient. CodeQL provided deeper analysis but 
took longer to run, while Bandit was quick but only worked for Python and had more basic checks. 
Overall, AppScan was user-friendly and worked well for quick scans.
